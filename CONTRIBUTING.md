## Can I create a pull request?

Yes or no, it depends on what you will try to do. Since I don't want to waste your time, be sure to **create an empty draft pull request or open an issue, so we can have a discussion first**. Especially for a large pull request or you don't know if it will be merged or not.

Here are some references:

### ✅ Usually accepted

- Bug fix
- Security fix
- Adding notification providers
- Adding new language keys

### ⚠️ Discussion required

- Large pull requests
- New features

### ❌ Won't be merged

- Do not pass the auto-test(we dont have auto-test now)
- Any breaking changes
- Duplicated pull requests
- Buggy
- Modifications or deletions of existing logic without a valid reason.
- Adding functions that is completely out of scope
- Converting existing code into other programming languages
- Unnecessarily large code changes that are hard to review and cause conflicts with other PRs.

The above cases may not cover all possible situations.

Also, please don't rush or ask for an ETA, especially for large pull requests.
