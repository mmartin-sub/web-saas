# Substantifik

The first is that we have a single interface for interacting with multiple large language model providers. This means that users can easily switch between different models without having to learn new APIs or authentication mechanisms.

An easy-to-use and enterprise-grade Next.js boilerplate.
Fork from [SaasFly](https://github.com/saasfly/saasfly)

## ⭐ Features

On top of the fork:

- Crowdin support including github action.
- add @neondatabase/serverless driver

## Recommendations

- Install [Stripe Cli client](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli) and [completion](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli/autocomplete)
- in github, setup some secret (see workflows)
- install i18next-scanner/i18next-scanner-typescript (i.e. `bun run 18next:scanner`)

## Setup

- i18n [config](apps/nextjs/src/config/i18n-config.ts)
- Crowdin steps, see [documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/i18n/crowdin)
- update FAQ from [price-faq-data.ts]£(apps/nextjs/src/config/price/price-faq-data.ts)
- extra documentation from (https://docs.saasfly.io/get-started/)[saasfly]

## Todo

- [ ] Need to support i18n for the .md or.mdx files for Contentlayer
- [ ] Integrate Cloudinary/Imgix or other image optimizer
- [ ] `bun run crowdin` not using the .env.local data while it seems there. at least crowdin is confused; maybe it is an EXPORT issue?
- [ ] Automate and optimize the translation process (using i18next-scanner or [i18n-js](https://github.com/fnando/i18n-js))
- [ ] Script to deploy dev, stage and prod with proper stripe connexion
- [ ] Setup name of the company, website and email from dict so it is easier to deploy to multiple domains (i.e. using more siteConfig.url)
- [ ] Review cors setup
- [ ] Remove k8s references
- [ ] Create a sitemap for robots.ts
- [ ] Load the price from stripe dynamically at build time so it stays cached versus static one and support multiple currencies
- [ ] Make apps/nextjs/src/components/typewriterEffectSmooth.tsx working with a long string versus manual split.
- [x] Review the logos (apps/nextjs/src/app/layout.tsx) and svg to work in dark and light mode.
- [ ] Update the review from apps/nextjs/src/components/comments.tsx based on actual twitter and comments from database. Show the number of hashtags based on input
- [ ] Add errors, not-found, global-error and other specific pages related to [NextJS routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing)
- [ ] Improve dynamic routing for (pages)/external for terms and privacy so UI looks better with headers and footers
- [ ] Add apply job, use cases sections (Uses cases per industry), terms and privacy link from footer
- [x] Many lint issue about any to clean-up from upstream
- [ ] Review dict variable types <Record> across code base
- [ ] Review stripe-pricing.json, so benefits and limitations can be translated with crowdin, need to extract sub-piece of the json.
- [ ] Propose Resend and other provider through (nodemailer)[https://community.nodemailer.com]
- [ ] Add a GDPR banner such as : We use tracking cookies to understand how you use the product and help us improve it! Please accept cookies to help us improve. if cookie is sent for tracking (not the case today)
- [ ] setup test scenario as per [https://authjs.dev/guides/testing] or Cypress

## Known issues

- [ ] Stripe web-hooks should return 200 as fast as possible, leverage sub/pub approach to do DB work async
- [ ] If Resend is sending an error, it is not cached
- [x] <p> cannot be a descendant of <p> from TypewriterEffectSmooths/TypewriterEffectImpl animation; the code is different to the source code for this component.
- [ ] upgrade missing dependencies (see ncu -ws) - turbo
- [ ] in package/stripe (packages/api/src/router/stripe.ts) access to json should be in different place and coming frokk prodä/dev approach
- [ ] there are some dict.common! for exmple in the code, not sure why ! is needed
- [ ] Create an account (register page) should have sign-up button, not Login with email
- [ ] Github auth was not working, code has been removed
