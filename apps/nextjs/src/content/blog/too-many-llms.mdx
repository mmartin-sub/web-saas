## A large paletter of LLMs
New Language models are made available every week, from large companies such as OpenAI or Google, from smaller players such as Claude or MistralAI.

## Need to find the best one for your use case
But it depends on the use cases or its capabilities (spoken languages, recognition of text or images, )

Need to balance the cost, and the quality for each use case.

Why not using AI to solve this problem?
