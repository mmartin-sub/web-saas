### Substantifik's Cookie Policy
This Cookie Policy is an integral part of our Privacy Policy. It explains how we use cookies on our website. Cookies are vital for enhancing your online experience with us.

It's important to note that this policy does not encompass the cookies used by these third parties. Should you prefer not to accept cookies from Substantifik, you can set your browser to reject cookies other than essential cookies. However, this may result in a limited experience on our site, as some services and content might become unavailable.

#### Understanding cookies
A cookie is a tiny data file stored on your device by a website you visit. It often includes details about the site, a unique identifier to recognize your browser on subsequent visits, the cookie's purpose, and its duration. Cookies have several uses - they enable website features, track site usage for analytics, remember your settings (like time zone and preferences), and personalize your experience (like showing relevant ads and language settings). First-party cookies are set by the site you're visiting, tracking only your activity on that site. Third-party cookies, however, are set by external sites and companies and might track your activity across multiple websites using the same service.

### Data security
We take reasonable steps to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Please note that data transmitted via the internet (e.g. via email communication) may be subject to security breaches.

#### Right to data portability
You have the right to have data which we process based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract automatically delivered to yourself or to a third party in a standard, machine-readable format.
