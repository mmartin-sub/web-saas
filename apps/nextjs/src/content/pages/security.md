# Security as a company value

Substantifik’ security & compliance principles guide how we deliver our products and services, enabling people to simply and securely access the digital world.

### Secure Personnel

Substantifik’takes the security of its data and that of its clients and customers seriously and ensures that only vetted personnel are given access to their resources.

All Substantifik’contractors and employees undergo background checks prior to being engaged or employed by us in accordance with local laws and industry best practices.
Confidentiality or other types of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) are signed by all employees, contractors, and others who have a need to access sensitive or internal information.
We embed the culture of security into our business by conducting employee security training & testing using current and emerging techniques and attack vectors.

### Secure Development

All development projects at Substantifik, including on-premises software products, support services, and our own Digital Identity Cloud offerings follow secure development lifecycle principles.
All development of new products, tools, and services, and major changes to existing ones, undergo a design review to ensure security requirements are incorporated into the proposed development.
All team members that are regularly involved in any system development undergo annual secure development training in coding or scripting languages that they work with as well as any other relevant training.
Software development is conducted in line with OWASP Top 10 recommendations for web application security.

### Secure Testing

Adaptive Automation Technologies deploys third-party penetration testing and vulnerability scanning of all production and Internet-facing systems on a regular basis.

All new systems and services are scanned prior to being deployed to production.
We perform penetration testing both by internal security engineers and external penetration testing companies on new systems and products or major changes to existing systems, services, and products to ensure a comprehensive and real-world view of our products & environment from multiple perspectives.
We perform static and dynamic software application security testing of all code, including open-source libraries, as part of our software development process.

All data is also encrypted at rest and in transmission to prevent any unauthorized access and prevent data breaches. Our entire platform is also continuously monitored by dedicated, highly trained Substantifik experts.
We implement role-based access controls and the principles of least privileged access and review revoke access as needed.
